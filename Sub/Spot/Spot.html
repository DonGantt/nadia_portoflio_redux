					Deliverables <br><br>
					Brand Identity Logo Design and 3D Animation
					Tools: Adobe Creative Suite and Blender

					<br><br>Synopsis<br><br>
					Spot is dedicated to providing easy-to-use water testing solutions that indicate the presence of
					biological and chemical contaminants. To reduce the spread of preventable diseases, Spot aims to
					provide clean and refreshing water quality assessment tools to those who lack direct access to
					sanitary drinking water.

					<br><br>Mission<br><br>
					Increasing its visibility in the media, Spot has enlisted me to create an identity that encompasses
					their mission: get people to think about the water they're drinking. Together, we developed a brand
					identity and produced 3D visualizations for a media campaign that demonstrated the dangers of
					drinking tainted water.

					<br><br>Logo<br><br>
					Based on contaminated petri dishes, Spot's logo mark was meant to exude a sense of trust within
					their customer base. The color palette expands on a saturated blue, nodding to clear water and
					symbolizing their commitment to users and science. Paired with white space, this color choice
					champions their dedication to cleanliness, purity, and quality.

					<br><br>Campaign<br><br>
					We launched a 3D media campaign that focuses on the repulsive nature of the microscopic pathogens
					found in dirty water. By inducing a sense of paranoia about drinking water, we were able to
					emphasize the significance of testing your water quality while providing a simple solution.

					<br><br>Results<br><br>
					These visual attributes establish Spot as the most reliable and available water testing organization
					in the industry.
