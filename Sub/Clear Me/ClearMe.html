					Background <br><br>
					Aging is a privilege not afforded to all. Yet, as the American healthcare system navigates a
					demographic shift toward an older population, the demand for healthcare professionals and caregivers
					continues to grow.
					<br><br>

					Care coordination is an imperative yet often overlooked determinant of patient health outcomes.
					According to a 2017 study conducted by the National Institutes of Health, ‘quality of care
					coordination, but not frequency of contact alone, is associated with better health outcomes for
					Medicare managed care (MMC) enrollees’ (National Institutes of Health, 2017).
					<br><br>
					The Challenge <br><br>
					There are many barriers that stand between patients and optimal healthcare. These include physical
					barriers to accessing care facilities, administrative hurdles that make managing appointments
					difficult, and the psychological strain placed on patient–caregiver relationships as they navigate
					these complex systems. When combined with the challenges of adopting new technologies and the
					difficulties of living with a disability, it becomes clear that navigating these obstacles can be
					overwhelming and disempowering. We can help facilitate better outcomes by making it easier for
					health coordinators and advocates to support their patients.
					<br><br>
					The Strategy <br><br>
					I've created a prototype made to help care coordinators care for their dependents.
					ClearMe is designed to bridge this gap by enhancing communication between patients, healthcare
					advocates, and care coordinators.
					<br><br>
					The UI positions ClearMe as a tool for supportive pioneers in the patient–caregiver relationship. At
					the center of its strategy, trust, transparency, consent, and usability are at the top of its
					priorities. This means designing for clarity, care, and compassion.
					<br><br>
					The Solution
					<br><br>
					Designing for clarity means building trust and consent by ensuring information is communicated
					securely and accessibly. ClearME prioritizes user-friendliness at every step, adapting to different
					levels of digital literacy. Information is compartmentalized through a bento-box structure,
					enhancing readability and eye tracking. Distracting elements are reduced, while expandable data
					points allow users to access quick summaries with the option to explore further when needed.
					<br><br>
					Designing for clarity enables a caregiver-centered approach while safeguarding patient privacy.
					Although users value the protection of their health information, there are moments when support from
					others is essential to continue their care journey. ClearMe addresses this balance by placing
					patient autonomy at the forefront. To achieve this, the platform offers three levels of consent that
					reflect the varying degrees of trust and responsibility in caregiving relationships. <br><br>
					The Primary Caregiver may be a nurse, family member, or full-time caretaker. This role serves as the
					leading health advocate, receiving real-time updates and granting consent to others when needed. The
					Secondary Caregiver might be a secondary nurse who provides backup support when the primary
					caregiver is unavailable. The Indirect Supporter offers occasional assistance and receives updates
					only upon request when the other two are not present, in case of emergencies. <br><br>
					Designing with care means prioritizing flexibility and transparency. By offering multiple methods
					for scheduling appointments, users are given greater opportunities for communication. Consistent
					reminders about insurance status ensure clarity across the platform, reinforcing trust at every
					step. <br><br>

					Combined with professional layouts, clean typography, and an updated healthcare visual identity,
					these features create a welcoming and compassionate environment that stands apart from other tools,
					which can often feel cold or impersonal.
